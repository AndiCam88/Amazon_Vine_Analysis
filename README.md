# Amazon_Vine_Analysis

## Purpose

The purpose of this analysis is to seek out a potential bias relationship between 5-star reviews and members of the paid Vine Program. The data selected was from the Video Game Review dataset from Amazon.com. 

### Vine Reviews

The Analysis of the data shows that:
- There are 94 total reviews registered with vine
- Of the 94 total vine reviews, 48 are 5-star reviews
- 51% of 5-star reviews are from the vine program

### Non-Vine Reviews

The Analysis of the data shows that:
- There are 40,471 total reviews not registered with vine
- Of the 40,471 total non-vine reviews, 15,663 are 5-star reviews
- 38% of 5-star reviews are not from the vine program

## Summary

The analysis of the data shows that 51% of 94 Vine Program participants rated their review 5-stars. 31% of 40,471 Non-Vine Program participants raited their review 5-stars. While there is a higher percentage of Vine Program 5-star reviews, there is an extremmly higher amount of Non-Vine Program reviews. I would determin that with such a high degree of varience between participanting numbers, more categories should be looked at before being able to determin significance.
